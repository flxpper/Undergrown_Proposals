Welcome to the Undergrown Proposals. <br/>
<br/>
Suggest Ideas/Features/Bug Fixes to this repo.<br/>
<br/>
### HOW<br/>
Please open an [issue](https://github.com/flxpper/Undergrown_Proposals/issues) and label it as `bug` / `feature` / `improvement` / `idea`.<br/>
<br/>
If its a bug:<br/>
Be sure to provide a clear and detailed description of the bug, including steps to reproduce it.<br/>
<br/>
If applicable, provide a save file `%USER%/Documents/My Games/Undergrown/saves/` to re-produce the bug.<br/>
Or video of the bug happening realtime.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
### How to label properly<br/>
BUG: `When something in the game happens that shouldn't, or results in a crash`<br/>
<br/>
FEATURE: `when you think, hey, the game needs this "thing"`<br/>
<br/>
IMPROVEMENT: `slight or major changes to existing things ingame`<br/>
ex: `crafting needs "show all craftable recipes" button.`<br/>
<br/>
IDEA: `Anything else that FEATURE label doesn't cover`<br/>
